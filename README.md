# Satisfactory Jupyter Notebooks

Hello, if you're here, there's a good chance you love Satisfactory and Jupyter Notebooks! Join the club.

My end goal is to design a data pipeline of a sorts based on my Production Worthy Jupyter Notebooks repo. I can then schedule that pipeline to run daily/hourly as I play and create snapshots of my activities and production reports.

Not really sure where all I will take it.

Follow along if you're interested!
